CMSC 434 ImpressionistApp

Hello! This app allows the user to create an impressionist drawing of a loaded image. Based on the pixel of the loaded image, we can obtain the color at that pixel and use it with different brushes to create a new variation of the image.

My Impressionist project includes the following features:

Changing Brush Types: Square, Circle, Line, Circle Splatter (Spray Paint). Note: Square/Circle brush change size based on velocity of movement. Circle splatter and line size is based on default size of 5.

Download feature: Images you can download are based on links to images online in MainActivity and will be downloaded to Photo Gallery.

Load feature: Allows you to load images that are in your Photo Gallery.

Save feature: Saves current impressionist drawing to Photo Gallery.

Clear feature: Clears current impressionist drawing.

Special feature: Share feature. Attaches image of drawing to text application so user can send to contacts/numbers.

To run this program, please download the project from GitHub and run through Android Studio.
